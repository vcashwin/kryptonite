## Overview

Every single time I want to login on a site that I use only sometimes, I have to click on `Forgot Password` and then create a new one as its tough to keep track of all these ones.

**Kryptonite** is an encrypted personal password manager that helps you track all the usernames and passwords for websites in one place. You can add them manually/edit them whenever and access them wherever you want.
